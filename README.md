## 🧰 Tooling Setup

This project uses ESLint integrated with Prettier to automatically format and lint your code.

If you’re using Visual Studio Code, install:
* [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Your editor should now show linting errors and automatically fix issues where possible.

## 🎨 Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and and includes pre-configured design tokens from the UNDP Design System.

## 🧭 Routing

Routing is powered by [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and uses a code-based configuration (in the `./src/main.tsx`).

### Adding A Route

Example: add an `/about` route:

```tsx
const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/about",
  component: () => <h1>About</h1>,
});
```

Then, register it in your `routeTree`:

```tsx
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, aboutRoute]);
```

You can define your component in another file:

```tsx
import About from "./components/About.tsx";

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/about",
  component: About,
});
```

More info: [Code Based Routing](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/code-based-routing).

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

Use the `Link` component for client-side navigation:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

More info: [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

## 🔍 Data Fetching

Data fetching is powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) for efficient, declarative data fetching and caching.
